{Composite Design Pattern}
--------------------------
{Definition}
The Composite Design Pattern allows you to compose objects into tree structures.
It makes the client treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

{When to use?}
* Tree like structures
* Handle simple objects and composite objects uniformly.

{Problem}
Lets say you have a box, within this box there can be smaller boxes and products
and within those boxes can be more boxes and products. So a nested case!. 
In this case how would we go about extracting all product id's in all of the boxes?
The direct approach would be to unwrap all boxes and go over each product and sum the id's. 
However this is extremely difficult.

{Solution to the stated problem}
We use the Composite Design Pattern: creating an interface with methods for getting all product id's. 
These methods are passed down the lenght of the three. 

{Design}
1. Component interface
Describes methods that are common to both simple and composite objects.

2. Leaf 
Basic element of the tree that does not contain sub-elements.
Be aware we need to implement all methods from interface (Therefore we thow unsupportedOperation error) 

3. Composite
Element of the tree that has sub-elements but does not know, the conrete.  

4. Client 
The client works with the interFace in which both the complex and simple objects use and therefore
the client can handle them uniformly.
