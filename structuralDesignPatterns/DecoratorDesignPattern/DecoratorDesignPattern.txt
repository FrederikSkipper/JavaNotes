{Decorator design pattern}
---------------------------

{Definition}
The decorator pattern allows us to add new functionality to an object dynamically without modifying the original code. 
It creates decorator classes that wrap the orginal object and adds new functionality and attributes thereto.

{Problem}
When we have a car object and we want to dynamacally construct the car via different sub-classes.
Then if we want to apply both sub-classes then we need to add an extra subclass just to deal with the instance of,
a car build that has both sub-classes.

Rules of hindering: 
Inheritance is static: meaning we cant alter an object via inheritance, we can only create a new object of the subclass type. 
The problem with that is: If we want to have more than one parent class WE CANT in this instance. (Subclasses cant inherit from multiple parents)
(FSD and Autopilot, would not both could extend a tesla)


{Solution to the stated problem}
Instead we create BaseDecorator class that is: A composition linked with the sub-classes and that delegates the work,
to these subclasses, in which they override the BaseDecorator class. 

{Design}
1. Component (Tesla interface)
It declares the common interface for decorators and concrete decorators.

2. Concrete Component (TeslaModelS, TeslaModelY)
The object we want to inject the decorators on. 
Their methods are the ones, we want to modify via the concrete decorators

3. Base decorator (TeslaDecorator)    
Delegates the work to the concrete decorators
Has object state, which concrete decorators extend and work on. 
This is the part that remembers the state of the Tesla, the methods are overridden by the concrete decorators.

4. Concrete decorators (FSD + autoPilot)
Define the extre behaviors and override the BaseDecorator. 

5. Client 
We can "wrap" the tesla in multiple layers e.g AutoPilot and FSD. 


{Tutorial}
1. Create product Interface
- The tesla interface

2. Implement concrete product 
- The TeslaModelY and TeslaModelS classes implements the interface

3. Develop the Decorator
- The TeslaDecorator abstract class implements the Tesla interface

4. Develop the concrete decorators
- The Autopilot and FSD classes which extends the TesalDecorator

5. Use the decorators
- Main
