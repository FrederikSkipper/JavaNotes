{Liskov's substitution}
* Instances of superclass should be able to be replaced by instances of subclass without effecting program. 
* Instances of subclass should be able to access all superclass methods and properties. 
* A class should not be extended only because they share something in common. 
* Composition is solution: Create a manager class

Example:
"A Cola is a derived class of Beverage and therefore we can swap them without behavioral changes"
