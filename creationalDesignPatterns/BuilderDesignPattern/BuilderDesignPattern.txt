{Builder design pattern}
The Builder design pattern allow us to create different variants of an object
while avoiding the confusion of constructor parameters. 

- Good for multiStep processes (unlike Factory)


{Definition}
The Builder Design Pattern lets us construct complex objects step by step.
Hereby we can create different representations of objects using the same constructor. 


{Problem}
When constructing complex objects it becomes a mess to remeber the order of arguments.


{Solution to the stated problem}
We create a Builder Interface to store the steps.
We define different concrete builders for different products / types of objects.
We define the director, to handle the different order for the different objects. 
This leads to the user ONLY neading to construct the matching director and builder. 


{Design}
1. Builder interface (Snack)
Construction steps common to all types of concrete builders

2. Concrete builder classes (DorritosBuilder and PopcornBuilder)
Define different implementations of the builder interface. 
See the difference in the SaltAmount in dorritos vs popcorn respective builders.

3. Products (dorritos)

4. Director (SnackDirector)
Determines the order of steps to take to construct.
Instead of the user calling each step, we have different recipies with the same ingedients functions, but different order.
We need to construct a popcorn different than a dorritos in the order, we mix the ingredients. 

{When to use?}
* When we want to construct different representations of the same product. (Different types of Snacks.)
