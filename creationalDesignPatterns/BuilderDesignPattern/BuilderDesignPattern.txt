{Builder design pattern}
The Builder design pattern allow us to create different variants of an object
while avoiding the confusion of constructor parameters. 

{Usecase}
It solves the constructor Anti-pattern, where we need to keep track of many parameters.
The builder fices this by calling a builder as parameter instead.
