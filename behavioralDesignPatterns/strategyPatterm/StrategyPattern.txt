{Strategy Design Pattern}

{Definition}
Allows us to define a set of algortihms and define them in different classes. 
So we can use them interchangeably. 

{When to use?}
1. Use when there is a need for dynamic changes of algorithms. fx: At runtime preferences are chosen, such that
the system must be able to switch between algortihms according to the preferences. 
* Use when you want to use different variations of an algortihm within an object.
* Use when you have similar classes that use the same functionality, but with different behaviors. 
{Problem}
We have one class for multiple algortihms. 
Breaks Solid principle Single Responsibility

{Design}
1. Context (Team)
The class that uses a Strategy. 

2. Strategy Interface (Soccer Strategy)
The strategy interface is implemented by all concrete Strategies.
It declares a method (formation) that the context (Team) uses.

3. Concrete Strategies (OffensiveStrategy and DefensiveStrategy)
Implement different variations of the method in the Interface.
