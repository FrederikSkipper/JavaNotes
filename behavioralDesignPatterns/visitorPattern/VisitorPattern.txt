{Visitor Design Pattern}

{Definition}
It seperates algortihms/behaviors from the objects they operate on.
Allowing us to add new behaviors without modifying the structure of the object. 

{Design}

1. Visitor interface (VechicleInspector)
Methods that take a concrete element (Car and Motorbike) as argument.

2. Concrete visitor (VechicleTest)
Implements the different behaviors from the visitor interface.

3. Element interface (Vechicle)
Contains method for accepting visitors.
The method contains the argument of the type of visitor.
In the example the type is VechicleTest visitor. 

4. Concrete element (VechicleTest)
The concrete element must implement their specific accept method.
The method takes a concrete visitor as argument and applies their behavior to the visitor.
