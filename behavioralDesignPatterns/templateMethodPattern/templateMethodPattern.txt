{Template Method Pattern}

{Definition}
Design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in superclass, 
but lets subclasses override steps of the algortihm, without it changing the stucture of the algorithm.

{Problem}
Break down an algorithm (assembleVechicle) so we can reuse the similar parts.

{Solution to the stated problem}

{Design}
1. Abstract class (Vechicle)
Declares template method, that is followed by all subclasses. 

2. Concrete class (car and motorBike)
The subclasses that can override all the steps, but not change the template method. 

{When to use?}
It is used when we have a general process that multiple classes follow, but some methods differ
and can therefore be overridden.
