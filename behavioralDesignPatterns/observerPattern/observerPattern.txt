{Observer Pattern}

{Definition}
The observer pattern defines a depency for notifying when an objects state is changed.
It notifies all objects that depend on said object and updates them automatically.

{When to use?}
1. Use when a change in one object result in a change in another object.
2. When one object should notify other objects.

{Problem}
Break down an algorithm (assembleVechicle) so we can reuse the similar parts.

{Solution to the stated problem}

{Design}
1. Subject (Subject interface)
The subject interface contains methods that the Subject supports and implements.

2. Observer (Observer interface)
Defines a method (update) that the concrete observers must implement, for them to handle and recieve notification. 

3. Concrete Subject (StockExchange)
It implements the Subject interface. 
Contains a list of observers and methods for handling those, such as iterating though them and updating the stock price.

4. Concrete Observer (StockApp)
Implement Observer interface and updates the current stockprice.
