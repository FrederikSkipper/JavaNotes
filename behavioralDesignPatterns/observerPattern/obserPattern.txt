{Obser Pattern}

{Definition}
The observer pattern defines a depency for notifying when an objects state is changed.
It notifies all objects that depend on said object and updates them automatically.

{Problem}
Break down an algorithm (assembleVechicle) so we can reuse the similar parts.

{Solution to the stated problem}

{Design}
1. Abstract class (Vechicle)
Declares template method, that is followed by all subclasses. 

2. Concrete class (car and motorBike)
The subclasses that can override all the steps, but not change the template method. 

{When to use?}
It is used when we have a general process that multiple classes follow, but some methods differ
and can therefore be overridden.
