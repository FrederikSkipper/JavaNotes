{upCasting}

{Definition}
Upcasting is converting a subclass ref to superclass ref. 
It is converting a Child object to a Parent object. 

{Access}
When we upcast a subclass object to a superclass it can access parent members and child methods overriding parent methods.
* Java always lets an object of a subclass (child) to be treated as an object of parent type (parent). {Because a child is a Parent}
* Happends automatic
