{DownCasting}

{Definition}
DownCasting is converting a superclass ref to subclass ref.
Converting a parent object to a child object. 
-------------------------------------------------------------
Child childRef = (Child) parentRef (We say to compiler trust me parentRef is a Child)
- we must ensure that the parentRef object is actually of the type Child. 
Parent parentRef = new Child(); // comes before the downcast line and is valid.
Here we know that the parentRef is a Child. 
Parent parentref = new Parent(); // RuntimeError (We lied to compiler) 


{Access}
* Access: When we downcast a superclass object to a subclass it can access parent and child members. 
* Does not work if typecast object is different from expected object. 
* With downcasting the object of the superclass can access the subclass methods and superclass methods.
