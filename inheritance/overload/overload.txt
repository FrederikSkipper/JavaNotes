{Overload}
{Defintition}
- Allow a class to have multiple methods with same name, but must have different parms.
- Can not overload by having a different return type alone. 
- Compiler chooses correct method based on reference variable type. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
{In relation to inheritance}
- If the parent method's parms are different from the child, then it is overload.
- Here return type of child does not matter, since it essentially is a new method.
