Interface
* Inside interface body objects cant be initialised
* Fields (variables) are static and final
* Methods are abstract by deafult (no body) - but privaten are allowe
* Members are by default public (also methods maybe?)
* Supports multiple inheritance (The main idea)
* No constructor - like before no objects
