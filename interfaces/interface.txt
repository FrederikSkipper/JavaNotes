Interface
SYNTAX: Class x implements interface a
* Inside interface body objects cant be initialised
* Fields (variables) are static and final
* Methods are abstract by deafult (no body) - but privaten are allowed
* Members are by default public (also methods maybe?)
* Supports multiple inheritance (The main idea)
* No constructor - like before no objects
* Static methods, CAN have a body but can NOT be overridden. 
* default methods, CAN have a body and SHOULD be overridden.

Interface and multiple inheritance.
* For interfaces with abstract methods: Inheritance of methods from multiple interfaces is ok. (Doublets dont matter since, the body isnt implemented) 
* For interfaces with non-abstract methods: Inheritance of methods from multiple interfaces must be overridden. (We cant have 2 homogeniuos functions with different output)
* The superclass methods wins, if inheriting from both a superclass and interface.
* The most specific superInterface
