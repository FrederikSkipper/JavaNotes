Checked and uncheked exceptions:
--------------------------------
[Checked]:
* Checked exceptions are problems outside the program code such as (FileNotFound)
* Checked exceptions need to be thrown!
* Checked exceptions are checked by the compiler at compiletime
* Classes under Exception except those under runtimeException are checked.

[UnChecked]:
* Logic problems.
* Checked at runtime
* Does not require handling at compile-time.
* Classes under error and runtimeExceptions are unchecked.

{Finally}
Executes no matter what (Also if we dont have a valid catch)

{Outside code}
Executes if exeption is dealt with via a try catch. 

{try}
The code in the try block will run be run until an exception accurs. 
If exception accurs at line 10, line 11 will not be run.
