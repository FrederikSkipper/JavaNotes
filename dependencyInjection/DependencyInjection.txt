{Dependecy injection}

{Definition}
A techinique used to solve Inversion of control between classes and their dependecies.
A dependency is an object that another object depends on.

{Problem}

in which results in duplicate code. We could also have made two different kind of mechanics but, that would
be in conflict with the Solid Principle "Single responsibility".
