Dynamic Binding / Late binding
* It takes place at runtime
* It uses overriding methods
* It uses virtuel functions (A method in superclass which can be overriden by a method in subclass)
* At runtime the compiler decides which method to choose based on the actual type of the object. 
* Compiler chooses actual object at runtime. Classref refobject = new object();  (See insect.java as example)
* Virtuel function (Function we expect to be overridden by sub-method)
